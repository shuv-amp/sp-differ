# Security Policy

SP-DIFFER is a testing framework. It does not hold production keys and should not be used as a wallet.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in the future code:
- Prefer a private security advisory when the repo is public.
- If private reporting is not available, open an issue and mark it security-sensitive.

We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix.
