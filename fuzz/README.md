# Fuzzing

This folder will contain fuzz harnesses and integration glue for both implementations. The goal is to generate valid cases, discover mismatches, and minimize them to stable regression cases.

Planned contents:
- Harness entry points.
- Seed corpus.
- Dictionary files for structured mutation.
