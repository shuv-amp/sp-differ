# Test Vectors

This folder will store official BIP 352 test vectors and any normalized derivative sets. Vectors are stored exactly as published and should not be edited. Any modifications go to a separate derived file with a clear provenance note.

`example.hex` is a canonical v1 case used as a reference for parsers. See `spec/EXAMPLE.md` for the decoded layout.
`output_ok.hex` is a minimal successful output payload. See `spec/OUTPUT_EXAMPLE.md`.
