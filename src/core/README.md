# Core

This folder will contain implementation-agnostic logic such as case parsing, normalization, comparison, and shared types.

Planned responsibilities:
- Case parsing and validation.
- Normalization rules and helpers.
- Comparator and diff classification.
- Canonical serialization for artifacts.
